Based on a statistical model of job seekers' prospects on the labor market; the system—that has become known as the AMS algorithm—is designed to classify clients of the AMS into three categories: those with high chances to find a job within half a year; those with mediocre prospects on the job market; and those clients with a bad outlook of employment in the next 2 years. Depending on the category a particular job seeker is classified under; they will be offered differing support in (re)entering the labor market  A coalition of civil society organizations started a campaign to rescind an algorithm used by Austria’s employment agency. The system has been declared illegal by the Austrian data protection agency.,National,Austria,AT,Public Employment Service Austria,Central-Government,Social protection,Unemployment.,Not in use anymore,2020,,Learning,Machine learning,Knowledge representation,,,,Public services and engagement,Service personalisation (various),Artificial Intelligence,G2C,Historical Data,Historical Data,Improved Public Service,,,x,x,,Open Government Capabilities,FALSE,,,,,,,,Open government capabilities,,,x,(https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000119486931/datenschutzbehoerde-kippt-umstrittenen-ams-algorithmus) https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdata.2020.00005/full; https://amsalgorithmus.at/ and https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000119486931/datenschutzbehoerde-kippt-umstrittenen-ams-algorithmus

Informatie Vlaanderen use it to detect and categorise the incoming questions faster and more 'finely-meshed'; and also integrate this 'finely-meshed' into the editorial management. In this way; the answers can be suggested more quickly; more adequately and also more 'automatically' to the answer provider; regardless of the chosen communication channel (oral or written). In essence; the project aims at two objectives: (1) the quicker and more efficient capturing and categorising of the question; and (2) the quicker and more efficient forwarding of the 'correctly captioned' question to the 'correct' answer provider with the 'correct' skills; whereby a valid and standardised answer (suggestion) is immediately sent along with it (so that the answer provider does not have to look up the intended answer script).,Regional,Belgium,BE2,Information Flanders; Belgium,Local Government,General public services,Executive and legislative organs; financial and fiscal affairs; external affairs.,Implemented,2020,,Communication,Natural language processing,Machine learning,Searching,Audio processing,speech recognition,Public services and engagement,Engagement management,Artificial Intelligence,G2C,Dynamic Data,Dynamic Data,Improved Public Service,,,x,x,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,FALSE,,,,https://www.innovatieveoverheidsopdrachten.be/en/projects/1700-supported-artificial-intelligence

9,Verontrustingen - Enabling accurate predictions to detect day-care services inspection,,The Flemish Agency for Child and Family (Kind en Gezin) developed an AI system which enables more accurate predictions to detect day-care services which require further inspection. These inspections enable the agencies to keep the quality of the day-care services high and to improve the wellbeing of children. In facts; there is limited capacity available to conduct all the inspections. The use of data had been considered as way to enhance existing inspection practices and optimize the scarce amount of inspectors. The predictive system developed uses a supervised machine learning method (logistic regression and XGBoost) to analyse various internal and external data from the Health Care Inspection Unit. Combining the recommendations of the predictive system with existing staff experience and expertise enables more targeted and data-driven interventions. ,National,Belgium,BE,Kind en Gezin; Belgium,Central-Government,Social protection,Family and children.,Implemented,2014,,Learning,Machine learning,Planning and Scheduling,Automated reasoning,,,Enforcement,Predictive enforcement processes,Artificial Intelligence,G2C,Historical Data,Historical Data,Improved Public Service,,,x,,,Open Government Capabilities,FALSE,,,,,,,,Open government capabilities,x,,,https://www.dialogic.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/VTOM-Small-Kids-Big-Data-Frank-Bongers-mei-2018.pdf

The application (OTT) provides job seekers with better and more accurate suggestions on where they could work and offers customized recommendations on re-education and reskilling. OTT is a tool used by civil servants to improve the understanding of the clients’ needs.

32,Traffic load - Machine vision for collecting information on traffic load,,The Tallinn transport Dep. started developing a machine vision application in autumn 2018 in collaboration with Sifr OU. The main objective of this application is to identify the traffic load within Tallinn; i.e. how many cars drive in and out of the city in a day in order to make city transport planning related decisions based on such data (e.g. parking issues; road construction; etc.). Three cameras were selected on intersections in Tallinn to train the application to count the vehicles passing by the cameras. The training of the application was a crucial process in developing the solution since there was no ready-made solution available that suited the circumstances of Tallinn. The result is an application that uses machine vision to count buses; cars; lorries and motorcycles and in the future hopefully also pedestrians; cyclists and like with a 70% accuracy on the traffic load in a certain area when previously there no such information available at all. ,Local,Estonia,EE,Public Transport and Traffic Management Transport Board in Tallinn,Local Government,Economic affairs,Transport,Implemented,2018,,Perception,Computer vision,Machine learning,,,,Enforcement,Smart Recognition processes,Artificial Intelligence,G2G,Dynamic Data,Location Data,FALSE,,,,,,Improved Administration Efficency,Improved Administrative Efficiency,,x,,x,,,,FALSE,,,,https://www.kratid.ee/tlt-kasutuslugu

Two cities involved (Tampere and Turku) carried out well-being surveys among its student populations; and - based on its results - clustered the students into the groups in need of different support. The study has discovered that factors such as reliability of the public transportation; and quality of the natural environment plays an important role in students’ well-being. Data retrieved from the study helped create a new cross-cutting public offering - a bot that would supply information about the topics that students found important. The uptake of the new service has been lackluster; leading the authorities to believe that only proactive marketing could change customers’ behaviour. Also it has been concluded that in order to pursue such projects further; municipalities need to develop user experience awareness and data analytics skills. ,National,Finland,FI,Munipality of Tampere and Turku,Local Government,Health,Health n.e.c.,Implemented,2021,,Learning,Machine learning,Automated reasoning,Automated reasoning,,,Public services and engagement,Service personalisation (various),Artificial Intelligence,G2C,Dynamic Data,Location Data,Improved Public Service,x,x,,x,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,FALSE,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308596120300689

However; France’s data protection watchdog CNIL called out the practice; saying it was not governed by any legal framework and was therefore illegal. The authority began a three-month test of its software from French tech company Datakalab this week at the Chatelet-Les-Halles station in the heart of Paris; normally used by about 33 million passengers per year. Monitors will have access to a dashboard with the proportion of riders believed to be wearing masks. The plan was mask wearing mandatory in public transport from May 2019.
